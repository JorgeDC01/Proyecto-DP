/*
    The class track represents the basic tracks (WITHOUT EXTRA COMPLEXITIES) where pilots will take part with their
    respective cars. The difference btw tracks are the complexity and distance to
    go down the track. This two settings will have influence in the efficiency of
    the pilot. This class implements the ITrack interface with the methods getComplexity,
    getDistance, getNoumExtras, getOriginalComplexity, getOriginalDistance and getNameTrack.
